All libraries used in this article are open source and dataset has been obtained using yfinance libraries. The USP of the plot is that the while hovering the mouse over the any point on plotted line displays information associated with the data point.In adddition the functionality has been provided to the user to zoom a selected area of graph. to zoom. Both these functionality makes it easier for an analyst to relate to the information and easly focus on aspecific period of interest. The enviorment used here is google-colab jupyter notebook. "
